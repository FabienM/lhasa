# Roadmap

## Business processes

Generate from observation a whole and consistent business process in standard BPM Notation.

Retry failed steps or place compensatory requests.

## Knowledge base

For each application, provide a Q&A or Board section to allow discussion between maintainers and consumers.

## Gamification badges

Show some badges on an application page to view which metrics could be enhanced to increase quality of service.

## Open API sandbox

If a service provides an API and a sandbox environment, provide a Swagger UI to allow discovering of the API.

## Change management

When a global information system change has to be performed (for instance, RGPD compliance), track the change progress
over all applications of the information system.
