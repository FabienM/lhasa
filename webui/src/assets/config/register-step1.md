Hi, 
  
As part of the STS 15 (proud to be a developer), OVH is in the process of listing and mapping all the applications of the Information System. 
If you are a developer / maintainer of this application, we need your help to enroll it properly in the catalog. This two-step wizard will help you producing a manifest file that you'll have to push to your git repository's master branch to finish the enrollment. 
  
### Why do I need to enroll my app ? 
  
In the short term, enrolling your app will only improve its visibility.  
List application releases (semver git tags) 
Centralize information (last contributors, release notes, RUN team contact info). 
List applications deployments (PROD-EU, PROD-CA, DEV-EU, ...) 
People will know that your app exists and will reach out to you to use it instead of re-developing the same feature set. 
  
In the longer term, appcatalog's roadmap should answer to more use cases : 
- List inter-application dependencies 
- Draw inter-application dependencies graphs 
- List business processes and know which applications they need toâ€¯finish properly 
- Improve the system's observability 
- Perform easy impact analysis (What is the business risk of deploying a new version of my app ?  What are the services impacted by a current bug?). 
- ...
