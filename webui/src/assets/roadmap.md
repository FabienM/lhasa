Urbanism team
-------------

Urbanism Team was born from a simple observation OVH Information systems have developed over the years, in a completely anarchic way, and in the optics of answering business problems.

With OVH growth it's time to offer more urbanization vision on internal SI and offer to OVH teams (business, application, infrastructure) more information on IS.
 
The compartmentalization of services and teams, the lack of communication and the opacity in the practices participate in this nebula that fatality makes abdicate the most motivated.
 
OVH do not know it's own SI and every change in production is synonymous with impact on others.

Realize and maintain an application mapping of OVH IS in a collaborative and automated way.

Objectives
----------
----------

Have a global, dynamic and up-to-date vision of OVH application and hardware portfolio

Easily identify the impacts of an upgrade on each deployment

Centralize the information (last committers, support team email, cisco, jabber) for OVH Teams

Get automated reports on the health of your IS

Have a dynamic view of the application mapping of your IS

Roadmap
-------
-------

Realize and maintain an application mapping of OVH IS in a collaborative and automated way.

Risk management thru toolset.

E-Learning / Information sharing thru a collaborative platform.

Application and infrastrcture mapping thru a service catalog and a cartography.

* Smart filters by criteria
* Collaborative mode
* Management of the validity date of the elements
* Impacts and Dependencies / Depth Metadata

Carto-SI's application mapping answers the problem of identifying the inter-application impacts encountered by IT stakeholders.

Risk management
---------------

</p>

As a developer (Urbanism Team is also developers) we want to reduce the risk of each design acitivities :
* Permit to developers to run easily tests (unit, integration …) over many environment (Staging, Production …)
* Use efficiently the OVH Micro Service eco-system (deploy, rollback …)
* Improve auto documentation (swagger, manifesto …)

API Management
--------------

<p align="center">

</p>

Improve knowledge about API Management Guidelines ….

Collaborative platform
----------------------

</p>

Application and OVHCLI ….
Gamification, continuous improvment

**our application catalog**'s application mapping answers the problem of identifying the inter-application impacts encountered by IT stakeholders.


Unity is strength
 
Collaborative and participative mode gives the floor to the knowledgeable as experts.
 
Each employee has access to his perimeter and can edit / validate the information in a few clicks.


Infrastructure and application mapping
--------------------------------------

<p align="center">
<img height="200" src="/assets/images/mapping.png">
</p>

Service catalog and cartography aim to show application and infrastructure mapping based on deployment event or any other data which permit this consolidated vision.

This data collect increase efficiency and performance, controlling the impact of OVH infrastructure on internal OVH applications and vice versa.
 
Identify the effects of a hardware failure on your applications and go back to the business layer at a glance.
 
You will also be able to manage your critical applications by providing them with an adapted response in terms of infrastructure and thus control the expenses related to the materials used.
 
Mastery and savings will be part of your daily vocabulary

Business process visualization
------------------------------

<p align="center">

</p>

One objective of our cartography is to represent OVH processes with simplicity and efficiency:
* Based on gateway eco-system observation
* Based on declarative data push by developers

Example of use cases :
* We want to quickly link a task to the application that processes it
* We want to know which part of the business is impacted when a given application is unavailable
* Or the impact of an application evolution on OVH activity
